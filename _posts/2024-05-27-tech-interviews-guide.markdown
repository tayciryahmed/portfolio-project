Over the years, I have had my fair share of technical interviews, both as an interviewer and an interviewee. I have interviewed at Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and LinkedIn, among others; with an onsite-to-offer rate of over 80%. As I often receive requests for advice on technical interviews preparation, I compiled my notes in this blog post. 

# Resume 
Below are some tips for writing resumes: 

**Formatting**: Your resume should be easily parsable by an automatic parsing tool; some companies have automatic resume scanners. Also, recruiters spend as little as 15 to 30 seconds assessing resumes. You want to make sure your resume is easy to read with emphasis on keywords when relevant. For ease of review, your resume has to be aesthetically simple, aligned vertically and horizontally. One tip is to use LaTeX, as it allows entering data as code without the need for manually adjusting the display and alignment. There are plenty of LaTeX resume templates on https://www.overleaf.com. I would also suggest you limit your resume to one page, unless you have +10 years of experience. 

**Title**: The title should include your name and goal if you're looking for a specific role (example: end-of-studies internship, graduate software engineer, etc.). 

**Contact Information**: Include your email, phone number and any relevant online accounts (LinkedIn, GitHub, StackOverflow, etc.). This section should be at the top of your resume for ease of reach. 

**Skills**: Include a _Skills_ section describing the major programming and technical tools you know. Include your level of proficiency whenever relevant. 

**Education**:  The most important information here is the degree and major (e.g. Master Degree in Computer Science). It should be the first information to highlight. Then, you need to include the (expected) graduation date and name of the university. 

**Experience**: In every experience, the most important information is the title (e.g. Data Science Intern), so consider putting that first, then the company name, timeframe and location. A rule of thumb for tech companies is to use the following format: “Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y] by doing [Z]”. Below is a concrete example: 
- **Accomplished [X]**: Improved device’s battery lifespan 
- **Measured by [Y]**: by 8% 
- **By Doing [Z]**: integrating a fuel gauge sensor and establishing a battery saving state. 

**Projects**: Include used technologies in all projects, and links to GitHub repositories whenever possible. 

**Certifications/Awards**: Include the exact name of the certificate or award, and links to verify authenticity online whenever possible.

# Coding Interviews 
Coding interviews preparation is the most straightforward, yet time and effort consuming. You need to have a good grasp of algorithms and data structures. The most tactical way to do this is to first study the most popular algorithms and data structures, then for each topic practice relevant coding questions. One very helpful resource I used over the years is https://neetcode.io. If you have limited time, you can focus on problems in the famous [Blind 75](https://neetcode.io/practice) list, but make sure you fully understand each of the problems and their solutions. Another tip is to try solving the problems on your own for at least 1h. If unsuccessful, I recommend you check the solution, understand it in detail, then revisit the problem later.  

If you have more preparation time, I recommend the books **Data Structures and Algorithms in Python** and **Elements of Programming Interviews in Python**. 

# System Design Interviews 
One of the most helpful and community-recognized resource for preparing for system design interviews is the course [Grokking Modern System Design Interview]( https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-modern-system-design-interview-for-engineers-managers). 

Additionally, the book [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) is very helpful for system design interviews. 

# Machine Learning Interviews
Depending on your target role, you may have machine learning interviews, usually as a variation of system design interviews for machine learning products. Assuming you already have a background in machine learning, you can prepare using popular machine learning sheetcheats and resources: 
- [Machine Learning tips and tricks cheat sheet by the Amidi twins](https://stanford.edu/~shervine/teaching/cs-229/cheatsheet-machine-learning-tips-and-tricks). 
- [Design a machine learning system by Chip Huyen](https://huyenchip.com/machine-learning-systems-design/design-a-machine-learning-system.html). 
- [Grokking the Machine Learning Interview course](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-machine-learning-interview).

You should also be familiar with recent advancements in Machine Learning. In 2024, I recommend the course [Generative AI with Large Language Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms). 

# Behavioral Interviews 
My recommendation for these interviews is to be your authentic self and give the interviewers a preview of how it's like to work with you. It can also help to reflect on your previous experience to find examples of demonstrating certain professional behavior patterns. One way to do that is to review behavioral interview questions (example [here](https://www.tryexponent.com/questions?type=behavioral&src=nav)) and reflect on examples from your experience. 

# Mock Interviews 
I recommend you try mock interviews before your actual interview loops. You can use https://www.pramp.com and/or request mock interviews from your network and peers. 

# Interview Schedule 
It's important to prepare well for interviews and take the necessary time to feel ready. It's usually acceptable to take 2-3 weeks for onsite interviews. You can confirm the timeline and expectations with the recruiter. Also, I recommend you take all the accommodations that the company offers to feel comfortable during the interview loops. 

# How can I help? 
I have helped many tech professional and aspiring students achieve their goals by reviewing their resumes and running mock interview sessions. If you're interested in getting help reviewing your resume or preparing for technical interviews, I am offering free mentorship sessions [here](https://mentors.codingcoach.io/u/66530c994474770664cda1b1?name=Taycir+Yahmed). 

# Final notes
It's important to remember that interviews are a two-way discussion. Ask questions for your interviewers to assess if the company is the right place for you to work. If at the offer stage you still have questions, most companies will offer or accept to connect you with a team member or manager to answer any additional questions.
