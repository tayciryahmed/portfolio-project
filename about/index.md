Hi there! Pleased to meet you. Take a look around and let me know if you have any questions, looking forward to working with you!

I'm a Software Engineer, with a background in Machine Learning. Before, I pursued three master degrees : Master of Science in Machine Learning, NLP and Computer Science at [Paris Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), Master of Science (French Grande Ecole Engineer's degree) in Data Science at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/home) and Master of Engineering in Information and Communication Technologies at [Sup'Com](http://www.supcom.mincom.tn/Fr/accueil_46_3).

During my studies, I have interned at IBM France Lab, IBM MENA, BNP Paribas and Renault. I was also selected to participate in [Huawei Seeds for the Future](https://huawei.eu/what-we-do/seeds-future) Program, where I studied Chinese in Beijing Language and Culture University and was trained in Huawei Labs. 

Previously, I have worked on a variety of projects, including credit scoring, customer satisfaction evaluation through written reviews, credit cards usage analysis, acoustic scenes identification, fake news detection, recommender systems, TV-series themed chatbots, neural machine translation, speech-to-text, multilingual text classification, search and re-ranking, etc. 

My driving motive is having a positive impact and building tools that are useful and meaningful.
